"""
cache_manager.py
-----------------
Demonstrates BOTH caching strategies required by the assignment.

How it works: LangChain has one global cache slot. set_llm_cache(...)
registers whichever cache object you pass it, and every subsequent LLM call
checks that cache automatically (matching prompt + model + params = a hit)
before spending money/time on a real API call.

InMemoryCache  -> lives only in RAM. Fastest. Wiped when the app restarts.
                  Good for "make repeated tests in this session fast".

SQLiteCache    -> lives in a `.langchain.db` file on disk. Slightly slower
                  than RAM but SURVIVES restarts, so identical questions
                  asked tomorrow are still served instantly and for free.
                  Good for "don't pay twice for the same question across
                  the whole app's lifetime".
